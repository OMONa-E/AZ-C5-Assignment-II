# HTML Table and List Concept

This HTML file demonstrates the usage of tables and lists in web development. It creates a timetable for a school or educational institution. Below is an overview of the structure and content of the HTML file.

## Table Structure

The HTML file includes a table with the following structure:

### Table Heading
- The table heading displays "Time Table" and spans across 6 columns.

### Table Body
- **Hours**: This column represents the hours of the day.
- **Days (Mon-Fri)**: These columns represent the days of the week (Monday to Friday).
- **Subjects**: The subjects are listed under each day.
  - For example, on Monday, there are Science and Social classes.
  - On Tuesday, there are Maths, History (with subtopics Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greek, Roman Empire), and English classes.
  - On Wednesday, there are Science and English classes.
  - On Thursday, there are Maths and Social classes.
  - On Friday, there are Arts and Sports classes.
- **Lunch**: There is a row indicating lunchtime, spanning across 5 columns.
- **Project**: This column represents project-related work and includes a list of topics (Self Driving Automobiles, Floating Experiment, 3D Modelling).

## Styling
The table and list are styled using CSS for better presentation.
- The table is centered on the page.
- Borders are added to the table, table headers, and table data cells.
- Unordered lists are styled with square bullets.

## Usage
